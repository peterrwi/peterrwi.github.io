          I am a sixth year PhD candidate in the <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Divison of Astronomy & Astrophysics</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles.
          I earned my bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics at the University of Southern California in 2015.
          My primary research interests are in understanding the physics of the broad emission line region in active galactic nuclei and making precise black hole mass measurements over a wide range of redshifts.
          Much of this work has been done as part of the <a href="https://www.physics.uci.edu/~barth/lamp.html" target="_blank">Lick AGN Monitoring Project</a>.
          I have also participated in research searching for gravitationally lensed quasars in wide-field surveys as part of the <a href="http://strides.astro.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">STRIDES</a> collaboration.
        </p>

          In addition to research, I help run the <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/planetarium/" target="_blank">UCLA Planetarium</a> on campus.
